Requirements:

- pkg-config (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config)
	(not needed when compiling a release using the included isl)
- gmp (http://gmplib.org/)
- libyaml (http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML)
	(only needed if you want to compile the pet executable)
- LLVM/clang libraries, 2.9 or higher (http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html)
	Unless you have some other reasons for wanting to use the svn version,
	it's best to install the latest release (3.3).
	The svn version occasionally introduces incompatibilities.
	Nevertheless, if you encounter any such incompatibilities, please
	report them so that they can be fixed.
	Also, if you are following the instructions on how to build
	the svn version, make sure you also install LLVM
	(through "make install").  You may want to specify an installation
	directory using the --prefix configure option.

	If you configure LLVM using cmake, you may end up with clang libraries
	that have been compiled with -fno-rtti without this option appearing
	in the output of "llvm-config --cxxflags".  You may then run into
	errors about undefined reference to the 'typeinfo' of some classes.
	You will then have to add this option manually to CXXFLAGS while
	configuring pet.

	The ubuntu package libclang-dev (3.0-3) is not sufficient as it does
	not contain the required libraries.

Preparing:

Grab the latest release and extract it or get the source from
the git repository as follows.  This process requires autoconf,
automake and libtool.

	git clone git://repo.or.cz/pet.git
	cd pet
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
	./autogen.sh

Compilation:

	./configure
	make
	make check

Use:

The main entry point is pet_scop_extract_from_C_source.
This function extracts a scop from the C source file with the given name
and returns it as a pet_scop.  The scop corresponds to the piece
of code delimited by

    #pragma scop

and

    #pragma endscop

The code in between needs to consist only of expression statements,
if statements and for statements.  All access relations and loop initializations
need to be piecewise quasi-affine.  Conditions are allowed to be non-affine,
in which case a separate statement is constructed to evaluate the condition.

If the autodetect option has been set, pet will try to automatically
detect a scop and no pragmas are required.  On the other hand, pet
will not produce any warnings in this case as any code that does not
satisfy the requirements is considered to lie outside of the scop.

The layout of pet_scop is documented in include/pet.h.
